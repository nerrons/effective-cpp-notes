# effective-cpp-notes
Notes for Scott Meyers' 2005 book, Effective C++. These are intended to be `Ctrl/âŒ˜-f`ed so it's in one single file. Don't skip the book.

I have [markdown](https://github.com/nerrons/effective-cpp-notes/blob/master/effective-cpp-notes.md) and [HTML](https://nerrons.com/effective-cpp-notes/#469a8c0b-c763-42e7-9831-9de921221cbd). They are exported from my own Notion library so they will have formatting issues.
